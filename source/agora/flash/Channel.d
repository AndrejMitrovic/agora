        This was a unilateral channel close.

        At this point the channel becomes closed and it is safe to destroy
        all of its associated data. If the counter-party was the initiator
        of the channel closure but did not attempt to collaborate on the close,
        or if the counter-party deliberately published an outdated settlement
        transaction, then the peer could be added to the local node's ban list.

        Note that it cannot be proven that a peer acted maliciously when
        publishing a stale update / settlement. Consider the following scenario:

        - Nodes A and B have settle & update transactions for seq 1.
        - They try to negotiate settle & update transactions for seq 2.
        - Node A receives settle & update for seq 2, but refuses to send back
          the update signature for seq 2 to Node B.
        - Node A stops collaborating for a long time, either deliberately or
          due to network issues.
        - Node B is forced to try to close the channel by publishing the trigger
          transaction and its latest update transaction with seq 1.
        - Node A comes back online, sees the trigger / update transactions
          published to the blockchain. It quickly publishes update with seq 2,
          and the associated settlement transaction.

        There was no loss of funds in the above case, but node B could appear
        to look like the bad actor to the external observers because it
        published a stale update transaction.

        In fact, neither node could necessarily be at fault. It's possible
        there was a network outage at Node A's side.

        At this time we're unaware of any algorithm that allows for an
        atomic swap of each others' secrets (signatures) to prevent having
        one party accept a signature but never returning its own signature back.
